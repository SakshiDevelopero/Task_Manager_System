# ✅ Task Manager System (MREN Stack + TypeScript)

A full-stack Task Management System developed using the MREN stack — MongoDB, React, Express, and Node.js — with complete TypeScript support on both frontend and backend.
The Task Manager System includes dynamic graphs and charts for performance analysis and task monitoring. 
These visual tools help admins and users understand task distribution, progress, and team efficiency in a glance.
The application is designed for teams or organizations to efficiently assign, track, and manage tasks with a responsive dashboard interface and real-time updates.
This system supports Admin and User roles, allowing the admin to assign tasks, set deadlines, add descriptions, and categorize tasks (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Database). 
Users can view their assigned tasks, mark progress (complete/incomplete), and upload related files or screenshots.
Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and modern user experience, the platform also incorporates secure JWT-based authentication, modular APIs.
